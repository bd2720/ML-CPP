# ML-CPP
A simple machine learning library for C++  
Classes:  
MDP - defines a Markov decision problem with a number of states (n_states)  
and actions (n_actions). States/actions are represented by integers, 0 < n.  
MDPValueIterator - given MDP, creates a V*k(s) function for assigning values to  
states using Value Iteration method.
